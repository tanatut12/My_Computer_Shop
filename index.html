            <h3>Keyboard</h3>
            <p>
              A keyboard is a flat device with buttons that you press to type
              letters, numbers, and symbols into a computer. It's like a
              typewriter, but for electronic devices. There are also special
              keys that can perform actions like copying, pasting, and taking
              screenshots.

            <h3>Mouse</h3>
            <p>
              A computer mouse is a small handheld device that you move on a
              flat surface to control the cursor on your computer screen. The
              movement of the mouse is translated into movement of the cursor,
              allowing you to point to and interact with things on the screen.
              Most mice have at least two buttons for clicking and selecting
              items. Gaming mice often have additional buttons and features for
              more precise control and customization.

            <h3>Headphone</h3>
            <p>
              Headphones are a pair of small speakers that you wear over or
              around your ears. They allow you to listen to audio privately,
              without disturbing others. Headphones come in wired and wireless
              varieties, and gaming headphones often have features like
              comfortable padding, noise cancellation, and a microphone for
              communication.
